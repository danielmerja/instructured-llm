‚ö° Building applications with LLMs through composability, with Go! ‚ö°

## ü§î What is this?

This is the Go language implementation of [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain).
This repo started as a fork of [tmc/langchain-go](https://github.com/tmc/langchain-go), but has begun to diverge now that the repo there is seeing less activitity and maintenance.
The name `instructured-llm` is derived from one of the new features added post-fork, allowing for programmatic, automatic creation of structured-json output inside of regular structs using reflection.

## üéâ Examples

See [./examples](./examples) for example usage.

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "log"

  "github.com/taigrr/instructured-llm/llms"
  "github.com/taigrr/instructured-llm/llms/openai"
)

func main() {
  ctx := context.Background()
  llm, err := openai.New()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  prompt := "What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"
  completion, err := llms.GenerateFromSinglePrompt(ctx, llm, prompt)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(completion)
}
```
